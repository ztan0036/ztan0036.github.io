        If you think that moral judgments are objective and rational, you are wrong.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Some researchers have proposed that moral judgment is not completely rational, but depends on the pursuit of personal interests, which is the means adopted by organisms to adapt to environmental changes.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Indeed, more and more research models emphasize the important role of emotion in moral judgment, that is, people with different emotions have different possibilities to make moral judgments. A study found that people’s sad emotional state has an impact on moral judgment, while a calm or happy emotional state has little effect on moral judgment.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Undoubtedly, it is difficult for people to achieve absolute rational judgment without being affected by emotions.

            <br/>
            Moral judgment is an intuitive reaction that includes emotions and is accompanied by a slow process of reasoning after the fact. The reasoning behind the fact is mainly to search for evidence that supports the judgment that has been made. In other words, our choices and their results can eventually come back to revise our moral judgments.

            He believes that moral judgment is the result of competition between cognition and emotion.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            If emotions win, the individual makes a moral judgment (for example, if the guilt of pushing a fat person is too great, he chooses not to act);
            <br/>
            <br/>
            If the cognition wins, the individual makes a utilitarian judgment (1:5, objectively it is more important to save five people).
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Studies on patients with brain injury have shown that when their ventromedial prefrontal lobe is damaged (the patient’s emotional function is weakened), and in a moral dilemma, they are also more inclined to make utilitarian judgments. This further validates the rationality of the dual-processing model: when individuals have difficulty in understanding their own emotions, the possibility of utilitarian choices will increase.

          <div id="page_3_2_3_right_3">
            Whether to make a utilitarian judgment or a moral judgment depends on how much emotion is involved. Emotion and cognition are integrated with each other in moral judgment.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            When emotional involvement increases, a moral judgment is made; when emotional involvement decreases, a utilitarian judgment is made.
