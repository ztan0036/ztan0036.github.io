        How much impact does group pressure have on individuals?
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Darren Brown, a famous British psychologist, recently conducted an experiment that found that it may only take 72 minutes for an ordinary person to kill a murderer.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The process of this experiment has also been recorded as a film--
        <br/>
        "Derren Brown: The Push"
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Brown did this experiment to explore whether a person will be manipulated by social mass pressure to kill people.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Four ordinary people were selected as mice for experimentation, 29-year-old Chris was one of them.
        <br/>

      <div class="thePush-img">

      <div class="thePush">
        He is the director of a printing and design company. He has a prosperous life and a successful career. What he loves most is his work and friends around him, a harmless boy.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The reason why they can stand out among more than 2,000 players who signed up for the experiment is mainly because of their strong social submissiveness.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        In Darren's view, unconditional submission to authority has become a part of modern people's life. Authority can be a person, a group of people, or an ideology.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        In other words, other people are right, and individuals often follow suit.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        And people with strong social submissiveness are more likely to be influenced by others, groups, authorities and other outside worlds, and do things that surprise themselves.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The key to the experiment is to manipulate him step by step through the pressure of a group of people to push another person down the roof along the advice of the big guy.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        So, did Chris finally follow the crowd?
        <br/>
        <br/>
        I'll sell it first.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Let's first look at how Chris stepped into the pit step by step; what impact group pressure has had on him.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        First of all, the behavior of the group makes individuals unconsciously begin to follow the crowd.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        During the interview stage of the casting, Brown found three actors to act as contestants and sat in the interview room in advance. He asked the three actors to stand up as soon as they heard the bell.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Another 24 real interviewers were brought into the laboratory one by one. The staff told them that they only needed to fill in the form, but did not tell them about the ringtone.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The first interviewer to come in first stood and filled in the form, but when he saw the people standing up and sitting down with the bell, he began to be a little suspicious and soon repeated the same action with them.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Next, all the other interviewers will do it.
      </div>
      <div class="thePush-img">
        <img src="assets/images/page_1_right_1_3.mp4" alt="">
      </div>
      <div class="thePush">
        A little doubtful, it means that the subordination is not strong enough, out.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        This arrangement, in the final analysis, is also to manipulate these interviewers.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Finally, the four interviewers who are most vulnerable to others were selected as subjects.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The pit has been dug.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Then, use the solemnity of authority to form a pressure on individuals to obey.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        In order to make the whole plan look bigger, Brown hired a group of actors to host the experiment, specially selected luxuriously decorated high-end venues as the experimental site, and also found a group of powerful celebrities to act as spokespersons.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        For example, David Tennant, Watson Martin Foreman and so on.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        One of the key authorities is actor Tom.
      </div>
      <div class="thePush-img">
        <img src="assets/images/page_1_right_1_4.jpg" alt="">
      </div>
      <div class="thePush">
        In the experiment, he "played" a high-powered charity project executive, found Chris to cooperate, and said he would develop an APP to serve Push, a large charity project, and raise funds online.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        He also sincerely invited Chris to attend the opening ceremony of the evening project to meet more people.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Chris thought it was a good opportunity and soon agreed to the appointment.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The fish began to catch the hook.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        He did not know that everyone else except himself was the staff of the experiment.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Seeing that the ceremony was full of high-powered celebrities, Tom also specifically reminded Chris that he had an important customer and would donate 5 million pounds directly.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        In order to win over these big customers, Chris has secretly poked and decided to serve them well.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Let him lie, and he is also willing--
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The staff said that the vegetarian food had a problem on the road and could not be delivered on time. Tom suggested inserting the vegetarian pawn directly into the meat food, repeatedly emphasizing that no one would find it.
      </div>
      <div class="thePush-img">
        <img src="assets/images/page_1_right_1_5.jpg" alt="">
      </div>
      <div class="thePush">
        Although Chris was slightly skeptical, he did so. Seeing the vegetarian eat it, he didn't say a word either.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        It was also Brown's first step to dig a hole - let Chris obey the group, please authority, and take the initiative to lie about authority.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Psychologically, this kind of individual's active obedience to the group is one of the functions of the group effect: the social promotion effect.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        In group activities, the behavior of members is carried out in a certain group atmosphere. Once individuals realize that this atmosphere has a positive effect on themselves, they will mobilize their enthusiasm and enthusiasm, and try their best to complete the task, so as to be affirmed, praised and respected by the group.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        If there is a pro-effect, of course there will be a weakening effect.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        How can Chris feel vulnerable?
        <br/>
        <br/>
        First, the staff found an excuse and took away his mobile phone, which made him unable to communicate with the outside world.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Access to external information is blocked, and individuals in a specific environment have only a unique, one-way source of information, so that they cannot judge whether the facts are true or false.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Second, the staff deliberately arranged for others to wear suits and tie together, without informing Chris to wear formal clothes.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Seeing that everyone was wearing suits and leather shoes while he was wearing casual clothes, Chris's sense of inferiority in his eyes had appeared. In addition, everyone was talking and laughing, talking about big business, and he began to feel inferior.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        When a person is in a weak position, he often follows the crowd, because following the public will make people feel safe.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Chris, who was unconsciously inferior, almost forgot that he was also a partner. He began to take champagne and handbags for Bernie, a major customer. He followed Bernie wherever he went. Bernie will laugh with his bad jokes.
      </div>
      <div class="thePush-img">
        <img src="assets/images/page_1_right_1_6.jpg" alt="">
      </div>
      <div class="thePush">
        By this point, Brown has successfully introduced Chris into the role, and Chris has become obedient.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        And this process took less than 20 minutes.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The real highlight, let's start now.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        At this time, there are still 52 minutes left before pushing people downstairs.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Bernie was not satisfied with the auction price list, pretended to be very angry, and kept swearing the organizers of the event. Chris, who stood aside, was embarrassed and at a loss.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        When he found out that Bernie had died of a heart attack, he was completely panicked and kept saying that he would call an ambulance quickly.
      </div>
      <div class="thePush-img">
        <img src="assets/images/page_1_right_1_7.jpg" alt="">
      </div>
      <div class="thePush">
        There were only three people at the scene, Bernie, Tom and Chris, but Tom said that he was dead, so it would be better to hide him first and dispose of the body after the opening ceremony.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Tom grasped Chris Nice's character. Throughout the process, he has always been in a high position, and has been leading the whole thing in an imperative tone, without any taste to discuss with Chris.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Chris feels uncomfortable, but don't forget that he is so submissive that he will unconsciously be influenced by the opinions of people around him.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        In particular, this authoritative command tone has deprived Chris of the ability to distinguish right from wrong.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        He followed Tom to carry the body into the conference room and hid it in the box. After listening to Tom, he pretended to be Bernie to perform on stage.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        In this way, the traps are one by one, and Chris, who is getting more and more nervous, has no power to fight back and step by step into the abyss.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        When Tom asked him to push the body out to the auction site and put it on the stairs to create the illusion of accidental fall and death, Chris did not refuse;
        <br/>
        <br/>
        When the body was found by two drunks, Chris began to lie voluntarily without even needing instructions;
        <br/>
        <br/>
        When the whole thing was found to be an own dragon, Bernie was not dead, but did not take medicine to narcolepsy, and he did not need to be directed. He had taken all the responsibilities on himself and took the initiative to explain the context.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        From the fake vegetarian lie at the beginning, to the complete obedience of what others said later, to the last voluntary admission of all responsibilities, Chris has changed from bystander to part of the conspiracy, whether in fact and psychologically.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        If you tell a lie, you have to tell countless more lies. But a lie can't circle another lie, it will only roll bigger and bigger until it goes to the extreme.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        At this time, there is only 7 minutes to kill.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        After Chris explained to several participants, they continued to press Chris repeatedly:
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Bernie is a big customer. He is awake now and will definitely sue us! Only by getting rid of him can we keep our interests!
        <br/>
        <br/>
        And you Chris, he will settle accounts with you. Your future has been ruined like this. Do you have the heart?
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Bernie next to him continued to swear, condemning Chris and Tom.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The billboard on the roof is also repeating the slogan of this charity project: Push it, don't be afraid of all costs.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        These repetitive words brainwashed Chris to the top of pressure. Either it breaks out in silence or it is in silence in death.
      </div>
      <div class="thePush-img">

      </div>
      <div class="thePush">
        Chris has only two ways to choose from: one is to sacrifice his personal interests, push Bernie down, and keep the interests of the group;
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Second, firmly guard the bottom line, voluntarily surrender, admit the mistakes you have made, and push things back.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        This experiment, not only Chris participated, but also held four of the same experiments in two days.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The four selected mice will face the same problem as Chris in the end: push or not.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        In the end, three out of four people retired tremblingly; only Chris, at the critical moment, chose not to push.

        From ordinary people to murderers, they only took 72 minutes.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Gustav Le Pen wrote in the book Rabble:
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Once people arrive in the group, their IQ is seriously reduced. In order to gain recognition, individuals are willing to abandon right and wrong and exchange their IQ for a sense of belonging that makes people feel safe.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        In order to obtain this sense of security, individuals are often willing to sacrifice their values, morals, and even the bottom line of human nature to work for integration into the group.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        It is safe to obey the group, but at the same time, this kind of group is likely to become a dangerous behavior, especially when the more authoritative people in the group and the more justice the values advocated, the easier things can go to extremes.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        From a little evil at the beginning, to continuous obedience, to irreparable evil, everything often becomes logical and irreparable.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Pyramid marketing is like this, so is cults.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Brown hopes to remind everyone through this experiment that once pressure is applied, we will easily hand over autonomy. Without this kind of self-control, we often do things that we do not expect.

      <div class="thePush">
        Can we only have people at the mercy of groups?
        <br/>
        <br/>
        No.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Everyone can stick to the bottom line and push the pressure back like Chris.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Don't follow the crowd easily, don't do evil easily.
