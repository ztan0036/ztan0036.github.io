        Your choice is more moralistic<br />
        <br />
        The criterion for moralism to judge whether a behavior is correct or <br />
        not lies in whether it conforms to the existing system, law or rule. <br />
        <br />
        In this way of thinking, the morality of the behavior is fixed and <br />
        has nothing to do with the situation. <br />
        This is a rule-based moral thinking.<br />
        <br />
        Most current public opinion agrees that it is a moral obligation not <br />
        to kill, so we should not take the lives of others.<br />
