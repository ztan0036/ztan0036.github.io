                As soon as a person enters a group, IQ is severely reduced. 
                <br/>
                <br/>
                In order to gain recognition, individuals are willing to abandon right and wrong and exchange IQ for a sense of belonging that makes people feel safer.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                In order to obtain this sense of security, individuals are often willing to sacrifice their own values, ethics, and even the bottom line of human nature to work hard to integrate into the group.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Groups have a social order of groups, and people in groups will consciously or unconsciously submit to this order.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                It is possible that this order is not his will, but in order to be able to integrate into the group, or to be unable to leave the group, he has to submit for the sake of safety.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                This blurs many boundaries, right and wrong, and values.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                The so-called personality independence is of course important, but in fact it is useful to make a person succumb to a correct individual and values.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Whether a group is beneficial to the public depends on what kind of dominant power it has. Is it selfish and selfish to control and suppress others, or is it cooperative and mutually beneficial
