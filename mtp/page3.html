                                        According to the Barcelona Declaration, "public space can help to create an environment conducive to the eradication of immigration-related difficulties by stimulating public debate about the numerous and overwhelming benefits that immigrants have provided to local communities." It is harmful to have myths and preconceptions about graffiti." Graffiti's "cool" vibe and the unsettling potential it possesses are two sides of the same coin. It arose as a result of the maverick's rebellion against authority, and it was suppressed by mainstream culture.

                                On a stroll down Bourke Street, it is common to see people acting in an unplanned manner. The efficient use of available space has allowed tourists to spend more time in specific locations, and this has resulted in stronger social bonds between people. Several researchers have stated that "in a well-designed and well-designed public space, the managerial oracle bones can be partially removed so that we can treat people as whole people." Carl, Francis, Rivlin, and Stone Helme have stated that By observing how others who are not like you react to the environment in different ways, you will be able to form a temporal bond with them. If the public environment does not have the ability to distinguish us from our everyday routines, it will not pique our interest in ourselves, and as a result, it will not provide opportunities for social engagement and participation in the community. The ability to communicate effectively in a variety of situations.
