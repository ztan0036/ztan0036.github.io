                    For the majority of residents in Melbourne's central business district, the streets, parks, cafes, bars,
                    and graffiti strewn throughout the city's back streets and alleys are the city's most appealing
                    features.
                    <br />
                    However, do you truly understand the ground beneath your feet?

                    <br />According to historical records, Melbourne was dormant for a time, and its current title of
                    "World's Most Livable City" is the result of more than two decades of urban space adjustment efforts. It
                    has witnessed the transformation of Melbourne's inner city, particularly the CBD area, from near
                    abandonment to rebirth.

                                        When it comes to Melbourne's city center, the fact that there is no decent

                                        space within the "Hoddle Road Network," as it is commonly known, is often
                                        overlooked.
                                        Flagpole Park, in the north-west of the city center, was established 38 years
                                        after
                                        Melbourne was founded as Australia's first public open green space. Flagpole

                                        conceived as a forerunner to the cemetery where the first colonists were
                                        entombed.

                                    In Melbourne's city center, for a long time, the public open spaces were little more
                                    than a collection of industrialized streets. As Melbourne grows from a small town to
                                    Australia's second largest city as a result of industrialization, the streets of
                                    Melbourne have nothing to do with comfort or convenience.

                                        This was not the result of a clerical error in urban planning, but rather a
                                        deliberate
                                        decision on the part of the colonial authorities. Initially, the colonists
                                        established
                                        themselves on the Australian continent primarily for economic purposes. The
                                        city's
                                        road
                                        network was created with the goal of quickly establishing a land market and
                                        selling
                                        development plots to private individuals at a profit. The colonists were
                                        concerned
                                        that
                                        public spaces, such as squares, would attract people with a wide range of
                                        demands,
                                        posing a threat to their ability to maintain their rule. According to a
                                        government
                                        official at the time, "the square will only serve to strengthen democratic
                                        principles."
                                        At the time of Melbourne's founding 180 years ago, "democracy" was not among the
                                        political options available to colonial officials dispatched by the British
                                        Empire
                                        to
                                        establish the colony.
